# paypal-button-php

This is a minimal implementation of PayPal's API 
to put a button on your website that allows your 
users to purchase digital goods.

If the payment is successful it just gives them
a file to download.

Put your digital goods in the `items/` directory
and set them up in `Inventory.php`. Make sure to
set your PayPal API key in `Settings.php` and test.

I have used this in my website [qwazix.com](https://qwazix.com)

This is not guaranteed to be secure.

Consider the code in the public domain.
